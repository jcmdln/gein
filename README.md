`gein` is a script for bootstrapping Gentoo onto a target device capable
of booting any live environment. While using the official Gentoo
installation media is preferred, the installation should also be
possible from any Fedora, Ubuntu, or other LiveCD.

`gein` is currently being re-written and should be considered unusable
until this sentence is no longer present in this file. Comments and
documentation are _not_ to be trusted at this time.
